Multiple Screens (MuSc)
===========

MuSc is a revolutionary web application capable of splitting pictures and video content to be displayed
across several independent screens. Contrary to traditional dual, tri, or multiple screen setups, MuSc
allows a screen array to be running on multiple machines while still being able to display multimedia content
seamlessly synchronized across the displays.
